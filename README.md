# GlenX
Tool for better genotyping of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data.

### Startup project: 
Try to find a good de novo assembly tool. I try Velvet, abyss and spades. To align the assembled reads (scaffolds) back to the ref genome again, I use bwa mem. 

#### What I tried so far: 

Get reads from specific region (start +/- 1kb - end +/- 1kb): 

```
samtools view -b file.bam "chrX:XXXXXX-XXXXX" "chrX:XXXXXX-XXXXXX" > regionX.bam
samtools view regionX.bam | awk '{print ">"$1"\n"$10}' > regionX.fasta

velveth velveth_out regionX.fasta
abyss-pe k-50 name=name in=regionX.fasta
spades.py --12 regionX.bam -o spades_out 

bwa mem -x intractg ref.fa assembled.fasta > aligned_assambled.sam
```
Velveth returns a fasta-file with all reads sorted, and after bwa I get a long sam-file - multiple steps -> i think I will skip this one!
Abyss - returns nice contigs. One good Ide could be to map contigs from different kmers. But; how do I get statistics from this? Look at sam! 
spades - finns på UPPMAX, ska testköra med inv_
SSAKE - Returnerar fler och kortare contigs -> ska kolla igenom!
tasr - ? 

Map reads back to contigs to get stats. - skip! This will not generate the maps that was originally created. 

Try to find other ways to get statistics for support!

Genotyping and classify type of SV;
From the mapped contigs a sam-file is generated. sam-file gives us information about direction of the reads and if they are matched or not matched to reference genome. 
Looking at the NOT matched contigs (S), I will get information about a SV and where it starts and ends. If this is mapped inside our regions of interest, we will call it a SV. And if we also have a contig that maps as match (M) to the reference genome, we can classify it as a heterozygous SV.   

Thoughts; 
go back to fasta-file generated by assembly tool, information about statistics? 

2017 - 09 - 26
	A few changes most be done on GlenX - genotyping. 
		1.	done	Read in TIDDIT tab-file with read coverage for every 100th bp.
		2.	done	Count average coverage 200 bp (exclude x- and y-chromosome due to different coverage?) 
		3. 	done	Update counting breakpoints adding D as important information. Take into count reverse strand (flip cigar). 
		4. 	done 	Make new array saving soft clips; strand, chr, pos, score, strand, chr, pos, score, cigar, contig length, number of alternative pos)					Have also added average position coverage.
		5. 	done	Save match as before in array! 
		6. 	done	Compare the two arrays, if not in region discard! 
		7. 	skip?		Get assambly read coverage from fasta, number of absolute kmers(?) that match to contig.
		8. 	better scoring?		If more than 1 in array; make some kind of scoring, selecting the most important one. For ex. a lot of cigars (complex), very short contig, a lot of alternative positions, low score etc.. Best score stays!
		8. 			Classify using tab-array, strand, position etc. Counting standard deviation and mean of entire chromosome for comparison with break-point region. NOTE! This will not work since the data are not normally distributed. First i have to normalize the data. Ex using gc normalization, mappability etc. 
		9. 			Write to new vcf-file! 

	
	GlenX - assembly
		1.	done	continue writing assambly.sh script. Run abyss * 3 (30, 50 and 70)
		2. 	done	Change id. for an example; >1 will be changed to >kmer_30_1
		3. 	done	merge 3 fasta-files to 1. 
		4.	done	Put bwa mem into assambly.sh
		5. 			Test!

Notes!

	1.

	After last meeting with J, we will run ABYSS like this: 

	ABYSS -k 30 -c X -o x_30 fasta
	ABYSS -k 50 -c X -0 x_50 fasta  
	ABYSS -k 70 -c X -o x_70 fasta
	Where X is the read coverage divided by 4.

	cat x_* >> merged_inv.fa

	bwa mem -x intractg /proj/b2016296/private/nobackup/annotation/human_g1k_v37.fasta merged_inv.fa > aligned_merged_inv.sam

	Run GlenX!

	2.

	SSAKE -f fasta -p0 -w1 -b sake_inv
	bwa mem -x intractg /proj/b2016296/private/nobackup/annotation/human_g1k_v37.fasta sake_inv.contig > aligned_sake_inv.sam

	SSAKE generates very short but many contigs. Can not alternative alignment (end_positions).
	After discussion with Jesper, we will skip SSAKE. 

	3. 
	Have already tried with abyss k-55 this results in 
	chrA 11 pos 30895551 chrB 11 pos 26504326 INV 0/1 -> pretty close to the expected chrA 11 pos 30895624 chrB 11 pos 26504276 INV 0/1

	Updated GlenX taking hard clipping into count, this will change the breakpoints. 


Next meeting:
Tab-file generated by TIDDIT have very
